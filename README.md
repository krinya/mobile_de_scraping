# Mobile.de web scraping scripts

Python scripts using BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape mobile.de.

Unfortunately only 50 pages of data can be scraped for each car make and model combination.

**1st step:** Get all make and model combination and create a link based on them (01_get_make_model_links.ipynb)

**2nd step:** Get all the ads link for the make and model combinations (02_get_links_for_make_models.ipynb)

**3rd step:** Get all data for each collected ads link (in progress)
